# InTheNight_Poem
Poem assignment for class. I created a poem with the same kind of code template as My House of Dust 

I decided to try and use what we learned in class to create this poem. I really like how it turned out 
and now I finally think I really understand how to create lists in code pretty easily. I'm going to try to 
use some more media sources (like novels) on my own but I wasn't ready to use that in this poem so I stuck 
with what I knew/kind thought I could do and it worked out. I love the self genrating prompts, it really 
churns up some intresting ideas. Like, who is that person? Why are they going there? Why are they working
with that tool? I want to know the backstory, which I find pretty compelling.
